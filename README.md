a hybrid project with both rest api calls and selenium to :
Rest API

 2. a their list of friends with most followers
 
Selenium:
  Goto home page for every user and screen shot it
  scroll to their top tweets and screen shot it
  go to one of their friends through search and then get who they are following
  
  Also including checking the differences on the data we got from api and on screen
